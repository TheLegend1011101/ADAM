Home! You are a special place;
you're where I wake and wash my face,
brush my teeth and comb my hair,
change my socks and underwear,
clean my ears and blow my nose,
try on all my parents’ clothes.

Home! You're where it’s warm inside,
where my tears are gently dried,
where I’m comforted and fed,
where I'm forced to go to bed,
where there’s always love to spare;
Home! I’m glad that you are there.
