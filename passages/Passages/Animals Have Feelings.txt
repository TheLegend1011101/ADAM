Every morning Pablo walks down the road to the village shop. He
goes to buy newspapers for his father. On his way to the shop he
passes in front of Dario's gate. Dario has a chubby pothound called
Bambi. Bambi stands at Dario's gate like a watchman. She is proud
to guard her master's home.

Pablo enjoys making fun of Bambi. He calls the dog ugly names. He
teases the dog with funny sounds like "oo aa, oo oo, boo boo, coo
coo." Bambi does not like it. She growls angrily at Pablo. She chases
him away. Sometimes Pablo pelts Bambi with large stones and runs
away. Bambi knows Pablo very well now. She even knows his shad-
ow. Whenever Pablo is on the road, Bambi starts to growl and bark.

Today, Pablo is about to hurl a large stone at Bambi. Dario shouts,
"Pablo, put down that stone now. Don't you know that animals have
feelings too?" Pablo races down the road. He pretends that he does
not hear Dario's words. Dario stands at the gate and waits for Pablo
to pass again. Pablo must pass that way. There is no other way to
get to his home.

Dario speaks to Pablo. "Pablo, you have been teasing my dog. I hear
you every day when you pass this way. You pelt my dog. I see you
every day when you pass this way. Don't you know that animals
have feelings too? Why are you so unkind?"

Pablo is about to tease Bambi again. Bambi is too fast for him. The
dog holds on to Pablo's trousers, ready to rip him to pieces. Luckily,
Dario holds on to Bambi's neck. He pulls the angry dog away. Pablo
is afraid and he is very annoyed. He wishes to fight the dog but can
he?

Dario again warns Pablo. He says, "Dogs are like people. They have
feelings too. If you hurt them, they may want to hurt you. Please do
not tease Bambi again. I think you have learnt a lesson today."
