Nancy went to spend the night with Grandpa and Grandma. Nancy
had never stayed away from home before. When it was time for bed,
Grandma showed Nancy her room.
“You give me a big bed, Grandma?” asked Nancy.
“Yes, it is all yours,” answered Grandma.
Nancy climbed upon the bed. Grandma gave her a warm blanket.
“This blanket will keep you warm, Nancy darling,” said Grandma.
Then she tucked Nancy under the blanket and kissed her goodnight.
“This bed is so much bigger than my bed at home,” Nancy said.
“Good-night Nancy, good-night,” said Grandma.
“Good-night Grandma,” replied Nancy.

After a while, Nancy called out, “I can’t sleep. It’s too dark in my
room. I am scared of the darkness.”
Grandma came into the room. “Well Nancy, I’ll turn on the night
light for you,” Grandma said.
Nancy closed her eyes. She tried to sleep, but she couldn't.
“Grandma! I still can’t sleep,” said Nancy.

Grandma rushed into Nancy’s room again and she turned on the
light.
“I know what you are missing, Nancy,” Grandma said. She gave
Nancy a large teddy bear. Nancy hugged her teddy bear and
Grandma left the room. Grandma wished that Nancy would fall
asleep.
“T still can’t sleep!” shouted Nancy.
This time Grandpa answered. He went into Nancy’s room. “Come
with me into the living room my dear,” said Grandpa.
Grandpa gave Nancy the telephone. “Do you wish to call someone,
Nancy?” he asked.
Nancy smiled. “Hello,” she said, “goodnight Mummy. I love you.”
Then Nancy jumped into her bed, hugged her teddy and was soon
fast asleep.
