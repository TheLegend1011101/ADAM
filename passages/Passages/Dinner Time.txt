Bill went to spend the holiday with Uncle Carl and Aunt Molly who
lived in the quiet countryside. One evening, Aunt Molly picked
some fresh vegetables from the garden to prepare a delicious dinner
for her family.

It was dinner time and the family sat around the table to enjoy their
meal. Aunty Molly asked Bill to say the grace before meal. The fami-
ly then started their evening’s meal.
“Please pass me the salad,” said Bill.
“Why, you have such good manners, Bill,” said Aunt Molly.
“We learn about good manners at school,” said Bill.
“How was your day in town, Uncle Carl?” asked Bill.
“Thad a good day, Bill. I bought seeds for planting and some garden
tools. I met my friend, Brent Lee, and we had lunch at a restaurant,” replied Uncle Carl.

“Today, I helped Aunt Molly with the dishes. We went into the
orchard and picked some mangoes and avocado,” said Bill.
“Bill did have a feast of the mangoes. I’m surprised he did not com-
plain of a tummy ache,” said Aunt Molly.
Bill said that he was really having a wonderful time in the country-
side.
“Please pass the carrots,” said Bill.
“Oh, these fresh carrots are delicious!” said Aunt Molly.
Bill bit the carrot slices. He did not like the taste of it. Bill remembered his manners. He must be polite. He chewed the carrots slowly
and then swallowed.
“The carrots are not like the mangoes I had today,” Bill said. Uncle
Carl and Aunt Molly looked at each other and smiled.
“I did not like carrots myself, when I was your age,” said Aunt
Molly.

Uncle Carl wished to serve Bill with something he would enjoy. He
went to the refrigerator. Out came a large chocolate cake.
“Oh!” Bill exclaimed. “I will certainly enjoy a slice of your chocolate
cake, Uncle Carl.”
Bill had a large chunk of chocolate cake. “Thank you Uncle Carl,
thank you Aunt Molly. You are so very kind to me.”

"You're always welcome to our home at any time,” replied Uncle
Carl and Aunt Molly. “It is a pleasure to have you.”
