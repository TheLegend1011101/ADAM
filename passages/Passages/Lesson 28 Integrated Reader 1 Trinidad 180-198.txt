Lesson 28

Pull Yourself Together 

Can your ear touch your elbow?
Can your tongue touch your nose? 
Can your fingers touch your feet and
tickle your toes?

Can your mouth reach your ankle?
Can your forehead reach your knees?
Can your arms reach around your middle
to give you a big squeeze? 

Can your fist fit into your armpit?
Can your feet fit in your lap?
Can your two hands fit together and go
clap, clap, clap?

Can your toenail meet your thumbnail?
Can your ankle meet your wrist?
Can your lips meet one another and have
a slurpy kiss?

Can your knee find your nostril?
Can your shoulder find your cheek?
Can your eyes find your eyelids and put
themselves to sleep?
