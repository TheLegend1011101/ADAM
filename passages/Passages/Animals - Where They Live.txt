Every living thing needs a home or habitat. This is a place where it
lives, eats and sleeps. It is also the place where it has its young ones.
The home of an animal must be comfortable to the animal. All animals cannot live in the same place or in the same way.

Animals that live in cold lands like the polar bear can bear the coldness. Their bodies are covered with furry coats. These animals cannot live in the hot deserts. Do you think a fish can live on the mountains? Animals that live in one kind of home may find it hard to live
in another.

One of the well known habitats of many animals is the forest. Many
kinds of birds live on the branches and trunks of trees. They feed on
insects. They also eat seeds of plants that grow in the forest.

Squirrels also build nests on forest trees. They feed on fruits and
nuts. Skunks that live in the forest eat berries and birdsâ€™ eggs. Snails
live on the leafy floor of the forest. They eat leaves that drop from
the trees. The forest provides homes and foods for many other animals. The raccoon, deer, agouti and opossum all live in the forest.

Many animals can live only in water. The water provides them with
a home and food. Fish live in water. They live in rivers and in the
sea. They cannot live on land because they have no limbs to walk
around. Fish swim and they breathe with their gills. Other creatures
are clams, oysters, jellyfish, whales, dolphins and sharks. These animals can live only in the ocean. Herons and frogs live partly on land
and partly in water.

Tf you dig under the twigs and leaves in the forest floor, you will
find slimy, brown earthworms. You will also see grubs in the soil.
Soon these grubs will be little insects creeping among the ferns and
mosses in the forest.

If you walk along you may see furry animals called moles. These
moles have long paws. They use their paws to find food under the
ground.
Animals have homes in the forest, in the water and under the earth.
