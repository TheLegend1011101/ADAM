Dear Anu,

	Thank you for your letter. It was
very interesting to find out about
Trinidad and Tobago. I have never
visited your country, but I think I
would like it.
	We also have many different
races of people in Guyana. The
Amerindians were the first set of
people to live here too. Guyana is a
very big country. It has four
counties. A county is made up of
many towns.
	Demerara is the smallest county
but the most important one.
Georgetown is in Demerara. It is the
capital city of Guyana. That is where
Ilive. It is a very busy place.
	Guyana is famous for many things.
4 We produce bauxite and gold. We also
grow rice, Sugar cane, coconuts,
ground provisions and vegetables.
Many people own cattle, pigs and
poultry.
	If you ever come to Guyana you
should visit the Demerara Harbour
Bridge. I like to go there to see the
ships. Many ships come into the
harbour. It is a fun place to be.
=z When I grow up I want to go to the
University of Guyana. I want to
become a doctor. What about you?
	It is great to be your pen pal. I hope
we get to meet soon. Please write
back. I love reading about your
country.

Your friend,
	Sasha
