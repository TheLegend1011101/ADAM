"What a windy day it is!" Joel says to his brother, Johnny.
"See the kites flying up in the clear, blue sky."
The pupils of the nearby school are flying their kites on the playground.
Their teacher, Miss Steven, is teaching them how to fly a
kite.

Joel and Johnny see the children flying their kites. They hurry home
to get their kite. They made it only yesterday. They too, will fly their
kite on this windy day. The boys open their kite. It is made with
strips of bamboo, white paper and coloured kite paper. The boys
chose the bright red, orange and green colours to make their kite.
The kite has a long tail. It is made from strings of cotton cloth. They
carry a large reel of thick thread to take the kite far into the air. Joel
names the kite "Appolo'".

John holds the tail of the kite. Joel runs with the kite backwards into
the thread to keep the kite up. The boys smile. "We've done it.
Appolo is soaring higher and higher in the breeze," says Johnny. Joel 
is feeling like a pilot steering his plane through the air.

Soon Appolo meets the other kites. How beautiful the kites look!
“See the lovely kites in the bright sky!” Joel exclaims. The wind is
blowing stronger and the kites are soaring higher and higher. All the
children keep moving as their kites travel across the sky. They drift
further and further away.

All the villagers come out to join in the fun. They clap their hands
and cheer the kite flyers on this lovely, windy day.
