Lesson 34

Caring for Dogs

Do you have a dog? Dogs make great pets. Many people
choose to have a dog as a pet — more than any other
animal.
	If you own a dog you need to take good care of it. A
dog does not need as much care as a small child. It does
need attention and regular care to stay happy and
healthy.
	All dogs are different and have different needs.
However, it is important for any dog to have a good diet.
Dogs need to eat foods that have enough vitamins,
minerals, carbohydrates, fats and proteins.
	Dry dog food or properly prepared home-made dog
food is the best food for dogs. Like all living things, dogs
need water. Make sure that your dog has fresh, clean
drinking water every day.
	Your dog also needs hard dog biscuits and, in some
cases, raw bones. These are good for the dog’s teeth.
	A dog also needs plenty of fresh air and exercise. The
bigger the dog, the more exercise he or she will need.
	If you are not prepared to exercise your dog every
day, then perhaps you should think about getting
another kind of pet. It is not fair to keep a dog shut up
inside.
	Regular exercise is good for your dog’s health. It also
gives him the opportunity to be with you! After all, dogs
need company and like to be with their owner as much
as possible.
	Then there is grooming. Dogs need to be bathed
and have their hair combed. It helps to keep fleas away
and their hair will stay soft and smooth. Soak your pet in
warm water. Use a pet shampoo in small amounts. Try
not to get soapy water in his eyes and ears.
	It is important to take your dog to the vet. A vet is
an animal doctor. The vet will make sure that your dog is
healthy.
	Finally, you need to love your dog. Give your dog
lots of cuddles and spend a lot of time with him or her.
Dogs like to be around people. Make sure your dog has
a warm, clean, comfortable doghouse.
	So now you know how to take care of a dog. Maybe
if you explain what you have just read to your parents,
you can persuade them to get you one!
