One bright, sunny day, a grasshopper saw some ants creeping along
the road. The ants were carrying food to their storerooms under the
ground.
"Good morning. It is a fine day, isn't it?" said the grasshopper.
The ants did not wish to talk to the grasshopper. They were busy
working. They had no time to idle. The grasshopper watched them
as they crept up and down. Then the grasshopper said, "Why are
you working on such a fine, sunny day? Now it's time to sit and rest
in the sun."

The ants replied, "No, no, now it's time to work. When winter comes
food will be hard to find. We must plan for the bad times long
before the bad times come."

The grasshopper laughed at the ants and flew swiftly away. Many
months went by and the days grew colder and colder. Winter came
upon the land. The earth was covered with snow.

Beneath the ground, the hardworking ants had stored enough food
for the winter. Above the ground sat the lonely grasshopper. It
looked thin and hungry. It was shaking with cold. How the
grasshopper thought of the busy ants. He said to himself, “I was
wrong to laugh at the hardworking ants. They were right to store
food for the winter.” The grasshopper thought of what the little ants
said, "We must plan for bad times long before the bad times come."
The grasshopper learned a lesson.
