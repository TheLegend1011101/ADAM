I can see my hero before me. He is about sixty years old. He is tall
and dark. His grey hairs shine like silver. I admire him. He is my 
grandfather.

My grandfather is hardworking. He is a farmer. I would like to be
like him when I grow up. Every morning Grandpa wakes up early.
He feeds his chickens and ducks. Then he takes his sheep and goats
to the pasture. After this, he takes his tools, his lunch and a bottle of
water to the fields. Sometimes he stays in the field for the whole
day. He takes care of the plants and the vegetables in his garden.
When he is tired, he sleeps under the shady trees. My grandfather
likes to work out on the land. He says that working on the land is
like living close to God.

My grandfather is very kind. When he reaps his fruits and vegetables he puts aside one huge basket. This he gives to his neighbours
and friends. My grandfather likes to share what he has reaped. He
teaches me to share with my friends.

PMy grandfather reads me stories and I listen to them. From these
stories, I learn many good lessons. I learn to show respect for my
elders and teachers.

My grandfather helps the villagers in many ways. They come to him
when they have problems. He gives them good advice. They like
talking to him. They respect him very much. He helps them to solve
their problems.

My grandfather has patience. Last year, there was no rain in the
land. All his crops died because there was no water. My grandfather
did not lose hope. He had lost everything, but he did not lose his
courage. He knew that he would plant again. His crops would grow
and bear fruits when the rain falls. 1 want to have the patience that
my grandfather has.

I pray every night to God to keep my grandfather safe and healthy. |
want to be like him when I get older. I adore my grandfather.
