The morning is bright and clear. The golden sun is shining. The children 
are out in the playfield. They are getting ready to play a game of
cricket.

Soon the sunlight disappears. Strong winds are blowing among the
branches of the trees. The children look up into the sky and see a dark
cloud moving with the wind. The wind begins to blow and the rain
begins to drizzle.

"It's going to rain!" Donald shouts, "let's get back into the house." The
children run quickly into the house. Grandpa comes into the house
too.
"I think there's going to be a storm," he says.
"A storm!" exclaim the children.

"Are you afraid of a storm?" Grandpa asks.
"I fear the loud clapping of the thunder," Joey says.
"And I fear the bright flashes of the lightning. It blinds my eyes," says
Veera.
"I do not like rain. It makes the playground wet," adds Randy.
"You are safe inside the house," says Grandpa. "We need the rain. Our
plants need the rain to grow."

Just then, the thunder booms and the lightning flashes. The children
cover their ears. Some of them cover their eyes.
"Are you afraid of storms, Grandpa?" asks little Peter.
"When I was a little boy like you, I was afraid of the storm," answers
Grandpa.
"Are you still afraid of a storm?" asks Peter.
"Oh no, I am not. We need the thunder, the lightning and the rain.
They all help the earth to become fresh and alive."

The children hold on to Grandpa's hands. They listen to the thunder,
and they look at the bright flashes of the lightning. They are not
afraid. They watch the rain beat upon the window pane and they see
the waters gushing down the drains.
"How lovely is the rain," they say.
"Grandpa! Grandpa! We are not scared anymore!" shouts little Peter.

Soon the thunder stops and the lightning does not flash anymore. The
rain stops too and the sun comes out again in the sky.
"How lovely is the sunlight," says Grandpa.
"How lovely is the sunlight," repeat the children.
