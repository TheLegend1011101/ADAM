The morning was bright and Syd was in a happy mood. He got
dressed and had his breakfast. Syd put his wallet into his back pocket, 
took his bookbag and walked towards the bus stop. Today, he
would buy his mom the present she always wanted for her birthday.

The day was beautiful. He did all his lessons and the teacher praised
him. When the bell rang for the children to be dismissed, Syd hurried 
out to the store. He did not want to be late. He must reach the
store before closing time.

The store was opened and there were many other children and
adults buying the things they needed. Syd put his hand in his pocket
to get his wallet. To his surprise, the wallet was not there. He
searched his pockets again carefully. He remembered that he had
put the wallet in the pocket of his trousers. It was not there.
Someone must have picked his pocket or it must have fallen somewhere. 
Syd was upset.

PSyd made his way to the bus stop to see if it had fallen there. He had
saved his money for this big day when he would buy his mother the
present. As he was walking, he saw a wallet lying by the bus stop.
The wallet was green. It did not belong to him. When he opened the
wallet, there was more than enough money to buy his mother the
present. Syd was very happy. Today, he would show his gratitude to
his mother.

Syd held the wallet tightly in his hand. Then he thought hard for a
while. Can I really take someone else’s wallet? That person must be
very worried about the money in the wallet. He has need for his
money, just as I have need for mine.

Syd quickly walked up to the guard at the store and gave him the
wallet. He said, “Please try to find the owner of this wallet. I found
it on the ground near the bus stop.”

The guard smiled at Syd and shook his hand. He shook his head, as
if to say, “you have done the right thing.” Syd felt pleased because
of his good deed.
