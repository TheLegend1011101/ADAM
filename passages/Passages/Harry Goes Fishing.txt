Harry's home is not very far from the river. Harry and his father
plan a fishing trip. At this time, there are many kinds of fish in the
river. Mother packs a basket of food, drinks and water. Harry and
his dad will have their lunch at the riverside. It is a dry, sunny day.
They get dressed and set off on their fishing trip.

Dad carries his home-made fishing rods. They collect a jar of worms.
They would use the worms as bait. Daddy fixes the hook on the rod 
and puts the bait on it. Now he throws it into the water.

The water is still. The fish do not come to the top. Harry becomes
a bored. He begins to sing a song. "Do not make any noise, boy,‚Äù
warns Harry's father, "Try to be quiet or you will scare the fish. A
fish is easily frightened, you know."

Harry keeps quiet. He eats his lunch and waits. Daddy tells
Harry that fishing is a good sport. He says that fishing trains
people to be patient. Harry listens to his father's advice. Harry
always dreams about the large fish in the river. Today he must
catch some fish to take home.

For three hours they keep their rods in the water. Harry feels a
tug on his line. "Look Dad! look! I have caught a large fish."
Harry pulls up his line. It is a pretty red tilapia. He jumps for
joy. Soon Daddy pulls up his line. He too, catches a large fish.
By the end of the day, they catch more than ten fish.

pIt is time to return home. Mother is waiting. She is going to
clean and cook the fish for dinner. The family enjoys eating
river fish. Dad says they taste sweeter than salt water fish.
"Please, Mom, would you fry some fish for me?" asks Harry.
His mom smiles and nods her head. The family enjoys a dinner 
of boiled cassava, pigeon peas, and fried and curried fish.

Harry's dad is pleased with his catch. He does not care how
Mom cooks the fish. Tomorrow, he will invite his friends over
for a bowl of fish broth. I am sure Mother will help to prepare
the broth.
