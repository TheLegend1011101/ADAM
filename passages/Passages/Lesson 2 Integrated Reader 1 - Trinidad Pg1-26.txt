Lesson 2

Plants

Where do plants come from? Every plant starts life as a
tiny seed. Even the tallest trees grow from this tiny
beginning. Inside each seed is a little plant. When a seed
is planted or falls into the soil the plant begins to grow.
	First the roots begin to grow down. Then a shoot
pushes up through the brown soil. Plants need water
and sunlight to grow. If a plant does not get enough
water and sunlight it will wither and die.
	Roots, stems and leaves play an important part in
keeping the plant alive. The roots have tiny hairs that
take in water from the soil. The soil also provides
nutrients that the plant gets through the hairs on the
roots. Some plants have one big root. Other plants have
many roots.
	The stem holds up the leaves and the flowers. The
stem has little tubes that carry water from the roots to
the leaves. Plants need water to take the nutrients
through the whole plant. Some plants can store water in
their stems, such as the cactus plant. These can grow in
very dry ground. Other plants have very long stems.
They crawl along walls and fences.
	The leaves use the energy from the sunlight to make
food for the plant. Most leaves are green. As they get
older, the leaves turn yellow or brown. Some plants
have leaves that remain green all year round. These are
called evergreen leaves. Evergreen plants make very
lovely decorations for houses.
	Do you know some reasons why plants are important?
People and animals get food from plants. Without plants
people would starve and die. Plants are also used to
make medicines. However, some plants have thorns that
can prick us!
	Trees can make great homes for animals and birds.
Often squirrels live in the trunks of big trees. From
plants we get cotton, gum, rubber and many other,
useful materials. Of course, plants are also used to
decorate our homes and gardens and to make our
environment beautiful.
