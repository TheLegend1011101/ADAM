They fly by night
When daylight goes away
And night comes on to stay
Fireflies come out to play.

Fireflies usually flit about at night in the warm part of
the countryside. Children like to watch fireflies flitting
among the bushes. Have you ever seen little bugs in the
dark night flashing their lights among the bushes? These
bugs are called fireflies. Some of them have wings while
others have no wings. The wingless bugs are called glowworms.
Although they look like bugs and worms, fireflies and glowworms 
are members of the beetle family. It is not true to say they are
worms or bugs.

Baby glowworms and fireflies hatch from eggs. The eggs develop
into larvae which resemble caterpillars. In this stage, the larvae or
caterpillars eat dead leaves, insects, worms and snails.

 Have you ever wondered how fireflies find one another in the darkness? 
The firefly flashes its red and green light together. The light
becomes very bright. You can then see your way in the darkness.

Where does the firefly get its light? The light comes from under its
body. In the body of the firefly there is a chemical called phosphorus.

It is the phosphorus which causes the firefly to light up and glow.
You may be surprised to learn that fish too, have phosphorus in their
bodies. When we see a fish shining on the surface of the water,
remember that it is the phosphorus that is glowing.
