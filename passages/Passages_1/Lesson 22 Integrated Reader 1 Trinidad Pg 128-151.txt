Lesson 22

Let’s Go Visiting

Do you like to visit famous places? This is also called
sightseeing. Many families go sightseeing during the
holidays. There are many famous places around the
Caribbean. Do you know any of them? Well, let us go
and visit in our imaginary tour bus.
	Our first stop is St. Lucia. We are going to visit the two
grand peaks of the Piton Mountains. They are over 2000
feet high. That is the most famous landmark in St. Lucia.
Can you see the top of the mountain? It looks like it is
touching the sky.
	Now let’s go to another country.
	Here we are in sunny Barbados. We are at the Queen's
Park in Bridgetown. Can you see that huge baobab tree?
It has the biggest trunk of any tree in Barbados.
	This tree was brought from Africa to Barbados a long
time ago. It is a great tree to climb. You could even sleep
on the wide branches! But not now, we still have places
to visit.
	Get ready to take a dive. We are at the Dolphin Cove in
Jamaica. This is the biggest maritime attraction in the
Caribbean. You can swim with dolphins here. The
dolphins are very friendly.
	That was fun, wasn’t it? There are so many more
places to visit but we have run out of time. Maybe we
will arrange another tour soon.
	Every country has its special places. Do you know the
famous places in your country?
