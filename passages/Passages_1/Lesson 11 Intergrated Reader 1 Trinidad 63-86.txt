Lesson 11

Food Time

What have you had to eat today? Did you eat bread and
eggs for your breakfast at home? Or maybe you had
some cereal and milk? What about lunch? Do you have
sandwiches in your lunchbox today? What about fruits
and vegetables? Are you going to eat some of those
today?
	Everything that we eat is called food. Everyone needs
food. It gives us energy. It makes our bones and muscle
strong. If we do not eat food we will become ill.
	The food we eat comes from many different places.
Some fruits, such as oranges and lemons, only grow
in hot countries. Other foods, such as potatoes, can
grow anywhere. Apples and grapes grow in cooler
places.
	When you go to the grocery store you will find many
kinds of food items. Each item has a label. The label tells
us where the food comes from. For example, on some
labels you will see ‘made in Denmark’ or ‘made in
Jamaica’.
	People who grow food are called farmers. Farmers
grow food such as wheat, which is used to make flour
They grow fruits and vegetables and they keep animals.
Farmers keep cows, goats, sheep and pigs. Many
farmers keep chickens on their farms too. These animals
give us milk, eggs and meat.
	Every food has a different taste. Some foods are
Sweet, some are sour, some are bitter and some have no
taste.
	Some foods have to be cooked and some can be
eaten raw. Some foods come in a tin, some in a box and
some in bags.
	Do you have a favourite food? Do you know where
your favourite food comes from? When you are having
your next meal, think about what you are eating. Try to
figure out where each item on your plate comes from.
