Lesson 13

A Letter From Trinidad

5 Albert Street,
San Fernando

6th August, 2009

Dear Sasha,

	My name is Anu. Iam your new pen
pal. My teacher gave our class names
to pick. We had to pick a name from a
box that was wrapped in silver paper.
I picked your name. I hope we will
write many letters to each other. I
am seven years old. How old are you?
	I would like to know about your
country. I have never been to Guyana.
My parents say it is a lovely place. I
can't wait to find out more from you.
	Trinidad is a small island. It is
much smaller than Guyana. My
teacher showed us a map of the whole
Caribbean. Trinidad is very near to
Venezuela. Have you ever been to
Venezuela? I saw it on the map. It is
joined to Guyana. At first I thought
the two countries were one, but of
course, I was wrong.
	I live in San Fernando. It is in the
southern part of Trinidad. San
Fernando is a big city. There are
many shops and business places
there. There are also many oil fields.
It is avery hilly place. There are hills
everywhere.
	Trinidad is avery exciting place to
live. We have many different races of
people here. Many of our ancestors
came from Africa, India, China and
England. The Amerindians were the
first people who lived in Trinidad.
Fiowever, there are not many left
today.
	Tobago is our sister island. I love
the beaches in Tobago. Every year I go
to Tobago with my family. We get to
go on the glass-bottom boat. I don’t
really like boat rides. I always think
of boats being wrecked! However, this
one is not too bad. When you look
through the glass y you ¢ can aes the
coral reef.
	I will write another letter to tell
you more about my country. Please
write back and. tell me about
Guyana.

Your pen pal,
Anu
