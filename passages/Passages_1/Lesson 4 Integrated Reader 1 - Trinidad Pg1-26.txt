Lesson 4

Sam’s Neighbourhood

Sam lives in a small town called El Dorado. His house is
on the main road. There are many houses along this
road. The road is always busy and noisy.
	Sam likes to stare at the cars and buses as they go by.
He loves to sit on his porch and count the cars.
	Today Sam is going to help his mother with the
shopping. They start at the supermarket. The
supermarket is big. Sam pushes the shopping cart for
Mom. Mom fills the cart with food and snacks. She also
buys some new glasses and dishes. Then she pays at
the checkout counter. She collects her change.
	Next Sam and his mother stop at the gas station. Sam
likes to see how the numbers move quickly when the
tank is being filled.
	Sam fastens his seat belt as Mom starts the engine.
Off they go again. Mom stops in front of the post office
She has to post some letters. Sam uses the wet sponge
to stick the stamps. Then they drop the envelopes in the
big red postbox.
	They get into the car again. Sam looks out as they
travel along the busy roads. They pass in front of the
pharmacy and the public library. Sam likes to go to the
library. He has a library card to check out books. Sam
sees his friend Mark in front of the library. He shouts out
at Mark. Mark shouts back and waves.
	Opposite the library is the police station. Sam likes to
watch the police cars in front of the station. Sam wants
to be a policeman when he grows up.
	Mom’s car moves slowly in the traffic. They pass
some stores and offices. There are many people on the
pavement. Some are walking, some are selling things
and some are chatting. They drive in front of Sam's
church. There are two churches on this street.
	Finally, the car turns into Sam’s garage. He is home
again. Sam helps his Mom to unpack the car. Then he
quickly goes up the stairs. He sits in his chair on the
porch. He has a good view of his neighbourhood from
his favourite place. Suddenly the phone rings. It must be
his Dad! Sam runs inside to chat with Dad on the phone.
