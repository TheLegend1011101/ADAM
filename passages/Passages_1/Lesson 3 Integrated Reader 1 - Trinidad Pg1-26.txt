Lesson 3

The Sunbeams

“What shall I send to the earth today?”
	Said the great, round, golden sun,
“Let us go down to work and play!"
	Said the sunbeams, every one.

Down to the earth the sunbeams crept,
	To children in their beds,
Touching the eyes of those who slept,
	And gilding the little heads.

“Wake, little children!” they cried in glee,
	“And from dreamland come away!
We've brought you a present! Wake and see!
	We've brought you a sunny day!”
